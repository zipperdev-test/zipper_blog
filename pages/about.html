                    Hello, I'm Zipper_ and my real name is Seo Hyuen. I like coding and English. 
                    I am a 12 years old elementary school 5th grader (in Korea) living in Korea. 
                    I used to coding with 'Scratch' but now I coding and learning Front-end.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="aboutPortfolio">
                <h1>
                    About This Portfolio
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I have been wanting to make The Portfolio about me. So I make one. 
                    This Portfolio contains My projects, About Me, and How to contact Me.
                    Now I want to talk about the things I went through when creating this portfolio.
                </p>
                <ul class="throughThings">
                    <li id="throughThingsTitle">Problems I've Got Through</li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>When Text was broken<span>2021.2.28</span></h3>
                        <p>
                            I was wondering why the text is crashing. 
                            Exactly I mean it sometimes crashes or overlaps and overlaps This is a 
                            bit of a big problem because it can be unnatural on the user side. So 
                            I searched for 'css crashing' and looked at 'blur'. I had already added 
                            CSS blur filters to text and images. I clicked the link, looked at the
                             description and reflected it in the css file, but it didn't go away. A
                            t the moment I have a great idea to delete the conflict. I removed the
                             blur filter for text and images and applied them to the divs surround
                            ing the text and images. And it works very well.
                        </p>
